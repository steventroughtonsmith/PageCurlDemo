PROJECT
PageCurlDemo

DESCRIPTION
This is a proof-of-concept project to show how to use the Page Curl CAFilter API on the iPhone to provide a transition similar to that in iBooks for flipping through pages. You can drag on a page and the curl will follow your finger.

This is the most basic of demo projects, and I haven't spent any time on making it a 1:1 representation of the iBooks implementation. The finger tracking could be made a lot more accurate, for example.
